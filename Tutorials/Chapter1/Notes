What is Rust : ? 



Rust is a compiled languaged , uses a compiler to translate the code into machine code ; comparable to C++

Rust was started as a side project ?? 

As fast as you can get to C without being C?

Why is it prefered from C/C++?


Rust tries to find the balance : 

1) Speed - Comparable to C/C++
2) Safety - C/C++ are unsafe in memory management, Rust tries to be
3) Concurrency - Multithreads can run in paralel, 
4) Portability - Compile once and run everywhere? Gets compiled into an exe, and then can work everywhere


Rust does not have Garbage Collection , it uses ownership and borrowing

Package Manager - > CARGO 

-----------------------------

Chapter 1 : 

Function definition :

A function is defined with fn() <function name> {

<function_body>;
}

after every changes to a .rs file , we would need to recompile with rustc then ./<file_name>



however we can create a project using CARGO , which is more efficient 

cargo new <ProjectName>
cd into ProjectName
perform changes on .rs file
cargo run !
